# Relational databases

This folder contains the examples from the relational databases chapter. These
examples are written to run into a SQLite database which does not require any
additional installation. The SQLite compatible driver to be used is available
at [github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3](github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) and is a CGO
package that requires gcc to be compiled. If you have issues installing this
package or getting the package with go modules, please refer to the original
documentation from the package.
